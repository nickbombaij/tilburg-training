Tools to Enhance Productivity, Collaboration, and Transparency
================

Pre-Tutorial Set-up Nick!
-------------------------

This tutorial provides an introduction to a collection of tools designed to increase research productivity, collaboration, and transparency. The content for this tutorial is largely drawn from a collection of trainings provided to research assistants in the quantitative marketing research lab at Brigham Young University.

This will be an interactive tutorial, so please prepare your laptop with the appropriate software and settings. Things to do prior to the start of the tutorial include:

-   Create a free github account
-   Install R and Rstudio
-   Install Git

Specific details on how to get started appear in Jenny Bryan's [pre-workshop set-up](https://happygitwithr.com/workshops.html?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiT1RVelptVTNZams0T0dZMiIsInQiOiJlR0orVlVpaHZsRlwveWh5QUJPN2U1Q3BcL0pHVHo5RXJ5UkhabFlwVXM4NlEwcHhRTENQZmVxaEEyNnVLSkRFTTdVa0hyNjk4MkFHYUU1Nkt5VXNtRm9heFM3N3dnUFplZ1V5anpRTWdnWDVscE1lOUR6VzBHaGFQOUFhOGd1QkN3In0=#pre-workshop-set-up). Please follow this link and complete the list of items in section 3.1. This can take up to a few hours, so plan accordingly. Note that the following Git/GitHub material draws heavily from Jenny Bryan's training on using Git and GitHub from rstudio::conf 2019.

Getting Started with GitHub
---------------------------

GitHub is a powerful collaboration and version control tool. We will be using it for *project management*, *writing*, and *coding*.

### Project Management

By project management I primarily mean keeping track of assigned tasks using the **Issues** tab on GitHub. We can have an ongoing conversation here about each specific issue and close it out when its completed or resolved. Be sure to tag collaborators you want to see the conversation (e.g., `@jeff-dotson`). Think of this as an email thread or Slack channel where all of the conversations are in one place, easily searchable, and automatically archived.

### Writing

Think of using GitHub to collaborate on writing like using something like Google Docs. It is essential that we document what we're doing in each project as we do it. This is true for a number of reasons.

1.  Writing forces you to think clearly about what you're doing.
2.  If you're coding, think of the associated writing as long-form comments.
3.  The final product of any project is going to be a paper, so start writing it now.

GitHub supports **markdown** syntax, which you're probably more familiar with than you might expect from time spent with **R Markdown**. Here are some [markdown basics](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html). We will be writing using *parameterized* R Markdown so we can easily reference model output instead of including it manually. The output in the **YAML**, the header at the top, should always be set to `output: github_document`. When you knit changes to your R Markdown document, it will create a markdown document that is easy for GitHub to read.

### Coding

GitHub was created for software developers. While we aren't developing software, we will be importing, wrangling, visualizing, and modeling data, and it's going to be essential for everyone to be on the same page. Even if you were just working solo, you will be collaborating with your past self and you should do yourself a favor and impose good version controls on your code.

GitHub Basics
-------------

Now that you're set up, let's get started.

### Just Once: Clone

First **clone** one of your repos, or a repo that you're a collaborator on. This is simply creating a local copy of the repo. You do this inside RStudio by creating a new project and selecting `Version Control > Git`.

### Daily Work: Commit, Push, Pull

Now you can open up the RStudio Project in the clone and work on the project. You have a new Git pane in RStudio that notifies you that changes you've made means you are out-of-sync with the **remote** repo (i.e., the one on GitHub). Once you've made a number of changes, you click on the files you want to **commit** and click commit. Think of a **commit** as saving a snapshot of all of the changes you've made across these files all at once. Include a clear commit message. You'll do this fairly frequently for your local repo, possibly just **amending** the same commit each time.

Eventually you'll be ready for other people to have access to your changes on the remote repo. To do this, you'll click on the green up arrow to **push** your changes to the remote repo. You push far less often than you commit, maybe once a work session, since this means you think it's ready for others to have access to. Each time you push, all of your commits are archived on the remote repo, including the **diff** or the side-by-side comparison of what changes you made to the previous version.

When you start a new work session, you'll want to click on the blue down arrow to **pull** the latest changes from the repo, possibly the work other collaborators have pushed, so you're synced.

### Collaborating: Branches and Pull Requests

Because GitHub is very systematic in the way it manages commits, we will run into commit errors when multiple people have changed the same thing at the same time. To avoid this problem, we will be using **branches**. Each branch is a separate version of the repo that exists in parallel, one where you can make changes or experiment without it affecting the **master** branch. In fact, the master branch is protected so that you can't accidentally push changes to it.

To do your work as a collaborator, create a new branch on GitHub with a short, descriptive name specific to the issue you're working on (e.g., `marc-paper-revision`). When you start a work session, make sure you select the branch you want to work on from the dropdown in the Git pane in RStudio. You can commit, push, and pull as usual to the branch you're working on. When you've completed work on the issue associated with the branch, create a **pull request** on GitHub and tag me (i.e., `@marcdotson`). This allows me to review what you've done, have a conversation with you about it, and then pull what you've done into the master branch. I'll then delete the branch specific to that issue. Rinse and repeat.

Project Organization
--------------------

Each project has a similar organization. There are certain limitations on the size and type of files that can be pushed to GitHub. There are also certain things that shouldn't be accessible by the public (e.g., data we have a licence to access). For these reasons, we have folders and files that are pushed to GitHub and those that are not.

### Pushed to GitHub

-   `/Code` Each script should do something specific (like tidyverse functions), have a descriptive name, and include number prefixes if they are meant to be run in a certain order (e.g., `01_import_data.R`, `02_clean_data.R`).
-   `/Data` While all data live here, only data that are small and can be shared publically will be pushed.
-   `/Figures` Figures live here, including images (saved as PNG files) and data referenced or used for tables, for use in the `README`, paper, and presentation.
-   `/Paper` The manuscript of the paper, without any PDF knits, including a specified Creative Commons license.
-   `/Presentation` Slides for presentations, again without any PDF knits.
-   `README` The abstract and any project-specific details and deviations from this outline.

### Not Pushed to GitHub

-   `/Output` Output from model runs. These files tend to be too large. They are also something each user can create on their own.
-   `/Readings` Loose papers that you want to keep track of reading locally. GitHub is not a paper management system.
-   `/Temporary` A catch-all folder for *temporary* files specific to a project that might not have anywhere else to live.

Note that you can create `Output`, `Readings`, and `Temporary` folders in your local clone without worrying about them being pushed. We can further modify the `.gitignore` file to add other folders and files that aren't pushed to GitHub.

Project Workflow
----------------

-   Use RStudio projects.
-   Use `here::here()` to specify files paths.
-   Use tidyverse functions as much as possible.
-   Try and follow the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org).
